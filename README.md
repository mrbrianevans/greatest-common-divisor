# Greatest common divisor algorithms
This is a mathematical problem, where the solution is the highest commmon factor of two input numbers.
For example, 5 is the highest common factor of 15 and 35.
<br> <br>
There are 3 main ways of algorithmically doing this:
<li> Euclids algorithm (found in Elements Book 7) from 2300 years ago
<li> Prime factorisation (the middle-school method)
<li> Consecutive integer checking (brute force)

<br>

In this project, I coded out each of the methods and wrote tests to verify their accuracy and compare their efficiency.
<br>
My solutions are coded in both Python, with a Java version coming soon...
